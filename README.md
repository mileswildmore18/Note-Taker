## Description
Welcome to the Note Taker, where you get a chance to explore the back end of website developing. This webpage was made from the routes and server side that gathers information and store it in the database, This project brings in data that the user inputs from the front end, and we give back the results of what they added to the webpage on notes. I learned about setting up the router in the background of this webpage where it gathers up information and connects to each route given in this project. With the pages that are given to the website, they will communicate with the server built in with the assigned port and making it listen for any information from the front end of what unique information is requested by the user and that the server gives back the information to the user with the results it found. Whenever the information is stored, the website has the power to save new notes put in, and offers the option to delete notes if they are not needed anymore. Have fun making notes!
